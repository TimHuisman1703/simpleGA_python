## Prerequisites

The code has been tested to work with Python 3.10.2. The necessary libraries that need to be installed can be found 
in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run the following command (preferably in a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

It is sufficient to run the `main.py` file. The file contains additional information on how to run specific
evaluations.
